# Zuma-clone game

The game is inspired by Zuma. Currently the basic gameplay features are implemented. I'm planning to add unique powerups. Menu, campaign, audio, etc. are not implemented yet.

The game is written in C++ with SDL2. SDL_renderer is used for graphics. Levels can be easily created from a few control points using Catmull-Rom splines.

You can make the background transparent by pressing T. And then you can play the game over Youtube videos, movies.

Controls: LMB to shoot, RMB to swap balls. T to make the window transparent.
