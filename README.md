# Zuma-clone game

The game is inspired by Zuma. Currently basic gameplay features are implemented. I'm planning to add unique powerups. Menu, campaign, audio, etc aren't implemented yet.

The game is written in C++ using SDL2. SDL_renderer graphics is used. Levels can be easily created from a few control points using Catmull-Rom splines.

You can make background transparent by pressing T. And then you can play the game on top of Youtube videos, movies. 

Controls: LMB to shoot, RMB to swap balls. T to make window transparent.
